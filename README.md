## Community 

This repository hosts proposals and discussions from the community 
on different aspects and activities of R-Ladies.

The process of soliciting feedback and comments is intended to provide a consistent 
and controlled way to make changes in our community in a transparent and participatory manner. 

R-Ladies is a global community, which gives us strength and the possibility to create something 
that goes beyond the sum of its parts, bringing many experiences, points of view and voices to the debate.

We aspire to a positive sum vision. To this end, we want to create a process of debate 
in which different perspectives and priorities are seen as legitimate and valuable, 
and through respectful and honest discussion we can find better solutions 
than if we had optimized only one perspective.

We also know this discussion will have emotional content, because when we care at 
any level about what weâ€™re discussing, then our emotions are going to play a role.  
We want to create a clear, transparent and safe process to have this discussion.

## When you need to follow this process

The Leadership Team and the Global Team will propouse topic for discussion.  
We will follow this process if we intend to make _substantial_ changes to R-Ladies.
What constitutes a "substantial" change is evolving based on community norms and 
varies depending on what part you are proposing to change, but may include the following:

- R-Ladies name, mision and vision.
- R-Ladies rules and guidelines, including governance and code of conduct.
- R-Ladies global infrastucture services.

Some changes do not require a community discussion:

- Update our organizer guide or propose a new chapter on the guide.
- Propose a new language translation.
- Create new R-Ladies chapters.
- Propose new activities between several chapters.
- Propose a blog post for R-Ladies website.
- Volunteer for being part of the Global Team.
