## Community 

This repository hosts proposals and discussions from the community 
on different aspects and activities of R-Ladies.

The process of soliciting feedback and comments is intended to provide a consistent 
and controlled way to make changes in our community in a transparent and participatory manner. 

R-Ladies is a global community, which gives us strength and the possibility to create something 
that goes beyond the sum of its parts, bringing many experiences, points of view and voices to the debate.

We aspire to a positive sum vision. To this end, we want to create a process of debate 
in which different perspectives and priorities are seen as legitimate and valuable, 
and through respectful and honest discussion we can find better solutions 
than if we had optimized only one perspective.

We also know this discussion will have emotional content, because when we care at 
any level about what weâ€™re discussing, then our emotions are going to play a role.  
We want to create a clear, transparent and safe process to have this discussion.
