## Community discussions

This repository hosts proposals and discussions from the community 
on different aspects and activities of R-Ladies.

The process of soliciting feedback and comments is intended to provide a consistent 
and transparent way to make changes in our community in a participatory manner. 

R-Ladies is a global community, which gives us strength and the possibility to create something 
that goes beyond the sum of its parts, bringing many experiences, points of view, and voices to the debate.

We aspire to a positive sum vision. To this end, we aim to create a process of debate 
in which different perspectives and priorities are seen as legitimate and valuable, 
and through respectful and honest discussion we can find better solutions 
than if we had optimized only one perspective.

We also acknowledge that discussions may have emotional content, because when we care at 
any level about what we are discussing, then our emotions may play a role.  

We want to create a clear, transparent and safe process to have this discussion.

## Scope of the community discussions

The Leadership Team and the Global Team will propose topic for discussion.  
We will follow this process if we intend to make _substantial_ changes to R-Ladies.
What constitutes a "substantial" change is evolving based on community norms and 
varies depending on what part you are proposing to change, but may include the following:

- R-Ladies name, mission and vision.
- R-Ladies rules and guidelines, including governance and code of conduct.
- R-Ladies global infrastructure services.

Some changes do not require a community discussion, for example:

- Update our organizer guide or propose new content in the guide.
- Propose a new language translation.
- Create new R-Ladies chapters.
- Propose new activities between several chapters.
- Propose a blog post for R-Ladies website.
- Volunteer to participate in the Global Team.

## Process for community discussions

1. The Leadership Team will create a discussion with a focused topic and will tag it 'soliciting feedback'.

2. This issue will have:
    * one-line summary (the title of the discussion).
    * the full text of the proposal.
    * any required background information.
    * pros and cons.
    * possible alternatives.
    * budget and staffing (if needed).
    * responsible moderator(s).
    
3. The discussion period starts. The period will last one month. 

4. We will advertise widely for participation on by notification on R-Ladies slack and emailing
R-Ladies chapters. 

4. All members of R-Ladies can participate in the discussion. 

5. Our code of conduct applied to this discussion.

6. The discussion will be moderated.

7. You can contact the moderator(s) for help.  Moderator(s) can post on 
your behalf or can teach you how to comment on GitHub discussions in case you:
  - don't know how to use GitHub discussions or 
  - you don't want to create a GitHub account or
  - you want to give your comment anonymously
  
8. Share and make all the points you consider relevant and important for the discussion.  
__We will not take into account something that was not written in the discussion forum when making the final decision__. 
This ensures transparency and the chance to share and discuss different points of view.

9. Near the conclusion of the discussion period, the month the moderator(s) will propose a "motion for final comment period".

10. This motion for final comment period (FCP) will provide a summary comment trying to lay out 
the current state of the discussion and major trade offs/points of disagreement. Will also change the tag to 'final comment period'.

11. The final comment period lasts 10 calendar days. It is also advertised widely. This way all stakeholders have a chance to lodge any final objections before a decision is reached.

12. If substantial new arguments or ideas are raised during this final comment period, the FCP is canceled, 
and the request for feedback issue goes back into development mode.

13. When this period finalizes, the issue will be tagged as 'Leadership Agenda'.

14. The Leadership Team will have the final discussion and decision over the topic in the next monthly meeting
of the board of directors.

15. The Leadership Team will report back with the motion, the decision made, and 
close the issue as 'completed'.

16. The Leadership Team will communicate the result of the discussion on R-Ladies slack and via email
to R-Ladies chapters. Depending on the scope, a News article on the R-Ladies website and social media postings
with the action items from the discussion may also be merited.
