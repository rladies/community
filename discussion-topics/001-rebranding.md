# Re-branding from R-Ladies to R-Ladies+    

## Proposal

The mission of R-Ladies Global is to promote gender diversity in the R community. The
intent is to support all minority genders, including but not limited to cis/trans 
women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, and agender. 

The Global Team has received feedback that not all minority genders identify with
the name "R-Ladies". In an effort to be inclusive of all minority genders, we 
propose for discussion re-branding from "R-Ladies" to "R-Ladies+". The plus here 
is meant to encompass minority genders that do not relate to the term "R-Ladies".

## Points of view

* From a chapter organizer: "_We had a couple of people who were non-binary/gender diverse and did not feel comfortable being a presenter due to our name R-Ladies._"

* From a social media comment: "_I'm still trying to make up my mind on whether to get in touch with the #RLadies community. If someone called me a lady I would laugh, but it seems to be inclusive?_"

## Pros 

Minority genders could feel more comfortable joining and participating in the community.

## Cons

In some countries being a minority gender is deemed illegal - a global
overview of this is available at <https://database.ilga.org/en>. In those countries,
hosting an event branded as R-Ladies+ could pose a risk to the event organizers and attendees
for persecution.

R-Ladies as a brand is widely known and recognized; changing the brand could
cause confusion or limit searchability. Discrepancies between handles and branding
across multiple platforms could cause confusion.


## Other Considerations

The name of our legal entity "R-Ladies Global" would not change. Similarly, handles for
already established social media accounts likely would not change.

However, labeling text could be updated to reflect "R-Ladies+ Global". New social
media accounts would have to consider whether the handle should include the `+` or not
in the handle, if it is an allowable character. 

There could also be a discrepancy between the global labeling and chapter labeling. Would
chapter social media accounts be re-labeled to R-Ladies+ CITYNAME? Would this be enforced or optional?

This list of pros, cons, and considerations is not exhaustive. Additional considerations are 
welcome, encouraged, and valued.

## Possible Alternatives

Alternative suggestions for branding are welcome and encouraged.
