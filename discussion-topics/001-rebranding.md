# Re-branding from R-Ladies to R-Ladies+    

## Proposal

The mission of R-Ladies Global is to promote gender diversity in the R community. The
intent is to support all minority genders, including but not limited to cis/trans 
women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, and agender. 

The Global Team has received feedback that not all minority genders identify with
the name "R-Ladies". In an effort to be inclusive of all minority genders, we 
propose for discussion re-branding from "R-Ladies" to "R-Ladies+". The plus here 
is meant to encompass minority genders that do not relate to the term "R-Ladies".

## Points of view

* From a chapter organizer: _We had a couple of people who were non-binary/gender diverse and did not feel comfortable being a presenter due to our name R-Ladies._

* From a social media comment: _I'm still trying to make up my mind on whether to get in touch with the #RLadies community. If someone called me a lady I would laugh, but it seems to be inclusive?_

## Pros 

Minority genders could feel more comfortable joining and participating in the community.

## Cons

The name of our legal entity "R-Ladies Global" would not change. Similarly, handles for
already established social media accounts like `@RLadiesGlobal` on Twitter would not change.
However, labeling text could be updated to reflect "R-Ladies+ Global". New social
media accounts would have to consider whether the handle should include the `+` or not
in the handle, if it is an allowable character. Discrepancies between handles and branding
across multiple platforms could cause confusion.

## Possible Alternatives

We are open to suggestions.

## Procedure

We value the community's feedback on this discussion. Please see the [Readme on the 
community repository](https://github.com/rladies/community#community-discussions) for the full discussion procedure.

Please do not invite contributors to this discussion on social media. The intent
is for this discussion to be open to only current or potential members of the 
R-Ladies community. You are welcome to invite contributors via direct messages, 
email, slack, etc.
